Hi, I'm Vatsal👋  

I make games, apps, art, tools, and more with the Unity engine. 

### What I do
Presently I am employed at [ManageXR](https://www.managexr.com) where I develop our Unity VR application and SDKs. You can see my professional and education background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vatsalambastha/).
  
My open source work is on [Github](https://www.github.com/adrenak). One of my more popular projects is [UniVoice](https://www.github.com/adrenak/univoice) for audio networking in Unity.
  
Aside from my day job and open source work, I try to always have a game project in progress. You can play the games I have developed games on [adrenak.itch.io](https://adrenak.itch.io/?ref=vatsalambastha.com).

There are some more things that I work on. These projects aren't dead, I just don't get to dedicate the amount of time I would like:
* A [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@VatsalAmbastha?ref=vatsalambastha.com) where I sometimes upload dev logs and UniVoice tutorials. 
* Sometimes I sketch and post them on Instagram [@brbsketching](https://www.instagram.com/brbsketching?ref=vatsalambastha.com).
* [Retro Reel](https://retroreel.app) which is an Android app for watching classic Hollywood movies in the public domain. It hosts around 2000 movies and has around 200K downloads on Google Play.
