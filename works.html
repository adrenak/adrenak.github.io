                An inhouse analytics and monetization tool made at Firexit. UnSDK combined several ad network SDKs into one, exposed them with a single API and collects data about rewarded ad viewership. The backend then profiles individual users based on their likelyhood to watch video ads and ranks them. This data can also be made between applications so an app leveraging this data can identify a high video ad viewer as soon as he/she uses the app for the first time.
                <br><br>
                The project had a successful pilot, profiling about 100,000 users of Speed Street : Tokyo but could ot be continued due to our lack of backend infrastructure and skills. Two years after this project was closed it seems more significant than ever. Futureplay's games monetize almost exclusively through video ads and they also use such tools.

                Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) was started in the 90s for managing nuclear waste. The site was meant to be designed in a way that its warning signs will last for tens of thousands of years but symbols are often repurposed and their meanings change with time. Michael Brill designed concepts for landscapes that serve as a warning through their very  structure. 
                Encadenor is a VR experience where the user is a member of a future civilisation and visits the WIPP to record observations.

                A big issue with VR videos is their network cost of streaming as well as the hardware load of decoding due to very high resolution. With researchers from HHI, I worked on developing a Unity3D video player that supports their video packing algorithm. In the end the code was able to help
                achieve optimization without the use of any shaders of ffmpeg, instead operating in vertex and UV space over complicated 8 dimensional data structures, resulting in playback of the equivalent of 6k resolution videos on a mobile device.

            <b>OPEN SOURCE</b>
            <br>
            Some of the more significant open source projects I have worked on.<br>

            <br>
            <div onclick="ToggleDiv('uniprep')" style="cursor:pointer">
                <u>UniPrep</u>
            </div>
            <div id='uniprep' style="display:none">
                The first thing I import in any project. Includes several additional keyboard shortcuts to the Unity Editor along with many C# extensions methods. Also includes utilities for object pooling, threading, coroutine management and others.

            <div onclick="ToggleDiv('unigenvr')" style="cursor:pointer">
                <u>UniGenVR</u>
            </div>
            <div id='unigenvr' style="display:none">
                A framework for Unity based mobile VR applications such as Cardboard and daydream. Helps create standard interactions such as walking, teleporting, triggering events, gaze based UI with no code. Completely modular in nature and very Unity inspectro driven.

            <div onclick="ToggleDiv('uniface')" style="cursor:pointer">
                <u>UniFace</u>
            </div>
            <div id='uniface' style="display:none">
                A C# library with a convenient API for manipulating UV triangles in real time. Forms the basis on my work with the Heinrich Hertz Institute for optimised VR video streaming.

                <u>UniMic</u>
            </div>
            <div id='unimic' style="display:none">
                Fuses Unity's AudioSource and Microphone classes to create a far better microphone. Used in almost all voice related project I have worked on.

            <div onclick="ToggleDiv('uni360media')" style="cursor:pointer">
                <u>Uni360Media</u>
            </div>
            <div id='uni360media' style="display:none">
                A completely code driven library for showing VR videos and images in Unity. The usual approach requires working with the editor and assembling things together by hand. Forms the boiler plate for almost all VR video related project I do.

            <div onclick="ToggleDiv('unicull')" style="cursor:pointer">
                <u>UniCull</u>
            </div>
            <div id='unicull' style="display:none">
                An important tool for my Unity optimizations, especially on mobile. Offers per mesh culling distance, which is a lot more flexible than a layer based distance culling technique. Also offers Screen Space Occlusion Culling, but that's really heavy right now. Once done, it would be great for procedurally generated worlds.

                <u>UniGOAP</u>
            </div>
            <div id='unigoap' style="display:none">
                A goal oriented action planning AI library for Unity. Not used this much as it is not complete enough to be a tool in itself, but it is almost there.

            <div onclick="ToggleDiv('airpeer')" style="cursor:pointer">
                <u>AirPeer</u>
            </div>
            <div id='airpeer' style="display:none">
                A WebRTC based Unity multiplayer SDK. WebRTC is amazing, but by itself it does not offer an API that can be used in a Unity app beyond sending text messages. AirPeer, currently under development will have Unity specific components and serialization as well as some other additional features like host migration that allow a Server/Client game in a P2P network to not get disrupted when the host disconnects.

                <u>dotMe</u>
            </div>
            <div id='dotme' style="display:none">
                A service that analysis your diaries (we can them safe) using AI based sentiment and language analysis to calculate a graph for your mental health. Uses the Big 5 traits as the fundamental assessment tool. *Not* fully open source.
