                    An inhouse analytics and monetization tool made at Firexit. UnSDK combined several ad network SDKs into one, 
                    exposed them with a single API and collected data about rewarded ad viewership. The backend then profiles 
                    individual users based on their likelihood to watch video ads and ranks them. This data can also be made 
                    available between applications so an app leveraging this data can identify a high video ad viewer as soon 
                    as he/she uses the app for the first time.
                    <br><br>

                    continued due to our lack of backend infrastructure and skills. Two years after this project was closed 
                    it seems more significant than ever. Futureplay's games monetize almost exclusively through video ads and 
                    they also use such tools.

                    Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) was started in the 90s for managing nuclear waste. The site was meant
                    to be designed in a way that its warning signs will last for tens of thousands of years but symbols 
                    are often repurposed and their meanings change with time. Michael Brill designed concepts for landscapes 
                    that serve as a warning through their very  structure.

                    A big issue with VR videos is their network cost of streaming as well as the hardware load of decoding due to

                    their video packing algorithm. 
                    
                    <br><br>In the end the code was able to help achieve optimization without the use of any custom shaders or ffmpeg, 
                    instead operating in vertex and UV space over complicated 8 dimensional data structures, resulting in 
                    playback of what is equivalent of 6k resolution videos on a mobile device.
