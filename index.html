											I work with teams looking to leverage Unity for games and beyond.
											<br><br>
											Working extensively on non-game applications in industries such as blockchain, military, R&D, entertainment, tourism, psychology, arts and humanities, edtech, training, fashion, eCommerce and more.

										<div class="company">Digibeings Media</div>
										<p>
											Digibeings is an early stage startup making AI powered virtual humans. I describe it as 'a programmable, customzable Siri with a virtual body'.

										<div class="company">The Zero Games (PLAKC)</div>
										<p>
											PLAKC was a dynamic in-game advertising tech. I handled all things related to the SDK and integrations. Our technology was used in some of the largest movie and sports IP based games in India.

											A game development studio started in Manipal. We developed games that reached over 5 million users on Android and Web. We handled work outsourced from larger studios. 
											<br><br>
											Pivoted to analytics and monetization tools in 2015, which was my segue to PLAKC when the studio was shut later that year.

										<div class="date">2011 - 2013</div>
										<div class="name">Indie Game Dev</div>
										<p>
											My earliest years in commercial game development. Unity WebPlayer was very popular and Android was yet to make a dent in the universe. 
											<br><br>
											I made XPro Rally and a few of its variants that did about a million hits. Got some sponsorship deals. Ported XPro Rally to Android in 2013 which got 10k+ downloads daily for some weeks.
											<br><br>
											My hobby started to transition into a profession during this phase.

											B.Tech. (Computer Science and Engineering)
											<br><br>
											Much of my time went into running my game studio Firexit Software. I was active in the student entrepreneurship and programming community, often invited to speak at or hold related events.
											<br><br>
											I interned at an early stage startup named 135 TechLabs working on a product called Hangoutt that rewarded game players with eCommerce coupons. My experience here set me on the path to work in the monetization and adtech space later on.
