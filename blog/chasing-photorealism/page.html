                Much of my game development work since I started has been on mobile. While I've certainly had fun doing that, I have realized that
                it has kept me from pushing myself further as far as pursuing graphical realism goes.
    
                <br><br>
    
                When it was released, people told me that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firexit.speedstreettokyo">Speed Street: Tokyo</a> had pretty
                good graphics for a mobile game in 2014. 
    
                <br><br>
    
                <img src="img/sst.jpg">
                <i><blockquote>Speed Street: Tokyo was okay.</blockquote></i>
    
    
                <br>
    
                But there's the problem right there.
    
                <br><br>
    
                It is only pretty good. For a mobile game. In 2014.
    
                <br><br>
    
                I recently thought of diversifying into architectural visualisations, especially because there is a lot of demand for them owing to the VR craze.
                Now, these visualizations need to be realistic looking, so I looked up some tutorials and
                found a nice timelapse video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX1qRM-lTEU" target="tut"><u>here</u></a>. Below is the end result of the video.
    
                <br><br>
    
                <img src="img/youtube-tut-img.jpg">
                <i><blockquote>Such skills. Much wow.</blockquote></i>
    
                <br>
    
                I was impressed. The video creater managed to assemble that in less than half an hour, assuming the video is sped up 4x.
                But then, I thought I also could do this. After all it is just a sequence of steps in a software I am already so familiar with.
                By 4 am (yeah, I started after dinner) I had managed to make a pretty good replica of the tutorial and also an original layout of my own.
                
                <br><br>
    
                I spent the week finding time whenever I could after work to make a few more. I got some models from <a href="http://www.archive3d.net" target="archive3d"><u>archive3d.net</u></a>.
                Problem is, all the models there are high poly and I end up with, like half a million polygons on the screen. Add lighting and the polycount goes up quickly.
    
                <br><br>
    
                So, I take the pre-made models and try them in the scene one by one. Then I just make low poly replicas. After all I am not a furniture designer.
                In a week, I managed to make 3 environments. I like the hotel room the most.
    
                <br><br>
    
                <img src="img/a3.jpg">
                <i><blockquote>A random apartment. Forgot to plan a kitchen and bathroom. So I call it an "apartment section".</blockquote></i>
    
                <br>
    
                <img src="img/g3.jpg">
                <i>><blockquote>An art galery. Made this for a client.</blockquote></i>
    
                <br>
    
                <img class src="img/h1.jpg">
                <i><blockquote>A hotel I stayed at last weekend in Bangalore. They had a full fledged mini kitchen. What economy budget hotel gives you that? So obviously I had to make this.</blockquote></i>
    
                <br>
    
                After the week ended today, I made <a href="https://www.behance.net/adrenak" target="behance"><u>my Behance account</u></a> and added these there. Check it out for more images of these environments.
                If I get good enough at making more realistic environments, I might write a guide sometime.
    
                <br><br>
    
                I like the idea of chasing photorealism, mostly because I want to make more of these real estate visualization things.
                However, when it comes to games, I remain indifferent. As far as my preference is concerned, I would rather see a good art style.
    
                <br><br>
    
                For instance, I played <a href="https://metkis.itch.io/indigo-child" target="indigo"><u>Indigo Child</u></a> yesterday.
    
                <br><br>
    
                Does it look realistic? No.
    
                <br><br>
    
                Did I love it? Yes. Very much.
