            I’ve been on a break for medical reasons for a little more than a couple of months. While my recovery has been slow and annoying I did just finish a project that was just a great way to recuperate. Great because it was a grim post-apocalyptic map. 
            <br><br>
            I spend too many hours on this because of limited budget and scope. Additionally, the assets I had to work with and the general look to be achieved were already given by the client. I was quite happy with the results in the end. This short post is about that.
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/img-1.jpg"></center>
            <blockquote>Can't really think of anything to write here.</blockquote>
            
            The major aspect of it that makes a post-apocalyptic map very interesting in my opinion is that its environment shows a past. An abandoned town hasn’t changed much in months or years and several events that took place are still quite apparent. Military bases and city environments for example don’t do that much because they are supposed to be maintained.
            <br><br>
            This gives room for creating a narrative experience through level design and environment art. The remains of the chaos that would ensue if an apocalypse were to come becomes an integral part of the environment design. Such as:
            <br><br>
            - Boarded up windows and doors, furniture used to secure doors when people tried to hide indoors
            <br><br>
            - Crashed cars and tire marks when people tried to run
            <br><br>
            - Military barricades that show signs of governments action
            <br><br>
            - Hate graffiti painted with human blood for the inevitable political bedlam and civil fallout?
        
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/img-2.jpg"></center>
            <blockquote>TL: boarding up windows, TR: smashed cars indicating roits, BL: robbed stores, BR: houses turned upside down</blockquote>
        
            All these are not just good to have details, they are essential for creating an authentic mood. Without this the environment is… lifeless (see what I did there?)
            On the other hand there is no real end to ideas so it can get overdone. In either case the level would look unrealistic, and even though the player may not be able to tell what is wrong, their brain tells that isn’t how an apocalypse will play out in real life.
            <br><br>
            I want to write more about somethings but don't have enough material yet. After I make more such scenes in the future hopefully there will be a part 2.
