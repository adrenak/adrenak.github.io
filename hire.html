        I've been developing on Unity engine since 2010. I'm a full stack game developer with my typical tools being C#, Unity, Photoshop and Blender3D. 
        (However these days I don't create 3D or 2D art myself wherever possible). I also create some levels and scenes.

        <br>

        <br>Whether you're thinking of having me over as a consultant or a developer, here is a non exhaustive
        list of things that I can help you with.
        
        <br>

        <br><i>(Click to expand)</i>

        <br><br>

        <div onclick="ToggleDiv('codequality')" style="cursor:pointer">
            <b>Code Quality</b>
        </div>
        <div id='codequality' style="display:none">
            <br>Having written, rewritten and read hundreds of thousands of Unity C# code across games, libraries, 
            open source projects, in-game products on a wide range of device platforms and industries; I have 
            the experience and knowledge to approach programs with good foresight. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Code that deviates from axiomatic wisdom will certainly manifest into an ugly mess given some time.
            One of the most common requirements I have from my clients (especially the technically sophisticated ones) 
            is to write, rewrite or review their code with exphasis on quality. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            While writing code I keep a balance between my just-get-it-to-work and refactor-everything mindsets, ensuring
            good momentum throughout. At the end I add the oil and polish to make it elegant and clean. My primary 
            guiding principles are modularity and emergence, which lead to the code having functional units at all times
            and them coming together at the end, quickly and predictably.
        </div>
        <hr>

        <br><br>

        <div onclick="ToggleDiv('proto')" style="cursor:pointer">
            <b>Prototyping</b>
        </div>
        <div id='proto' style="display:none">
            Starting off with a prototype alone puts a team ahead of most. Prototypes keep expenses low and allow for 
            lean, flexible and methodical development. One of the common problems I see is that the foundation of the
            game is not flexible enough to allow for changes required by the designer, undoing the benefit of prototyping
            altogether. 
            
            <br><br>

            This becomes an interation hell if there is ample motivation from analytics data to make a 
            design change, but changes are made with ad hoc hacks and eventually result in a rigid codebase. Teams
            either go for an expensive redevelopment, or more commonly just give up on updating their game.
    
            <br><br>
    
            From a coding point of view, I usually approach this with the development of highly generic and composable
            modules, that are can be combined in ways to produce wide ranging behaviours. These typically also goes into 
            a wide, use-case neutral codebase as well, an investment that leads to massive returns over time.

        <div onclick="ToggleDiv('prod')" style="cursor:pointer">
            <b>Product</b>
        </div>
        <div id='prod' style="display:none">
            Being a full stack game dev who has at least decent competence over graphics, code, design and audio each; I can work
            with multi disciplinery people to make sure their works remain independent of each other, reasonably minimise
            assumptions and enable communication.
    
            <br><br>
    
            Having worked on in-house tech solutions, contractual projects, B2B products, I bring with me experience of dealing
            with a host of problems. This includes lessons in dev ops, support, documentation, deployment, automation
            outsourcing and a lot of effort that goes in ensuring that milestones are met from conception to ongoing post-release 
            tasks.

        <div onclick="ToggleDiv('exp')" style="cursor:pointer">
            <b>Art & Alt Games</b>
        </div>
        <div id='exp' style="display:none">
            It is perhaps Virtual Reality that has kicked off a trend of virtual experiences in the art community that I have worked on
            extensively recently and have many, many projects of my own as well. These are unconventional applications of gaming
            technology for the purpose of artistic expression. If you don't get what I mean, Googe "Ian Cheng Simulations" or look up
            #altgames on Twitter.

            <br><br>
            
            My clients for such projects being artists, can be particular about small details. As someone who has tremendous genuine
            interest in such interdiscplinary projects, I am more than happy to spend the time to perfect everything. I am even up for
            a non commercial, very indie collaboration on such projects.
