__6.7.18__

I was thinking about all the books I have in my small library at home and how much smarter I would be if I read them. There is a bunch of things I was to read during this year and learn extensively in the process.
  
Saw my copy of `Masters of Doom` today and recalled how `John Carmack` wrote his `.plan` files many decades ago. I decided it would not be a bad idea to write blogs more often myself. Hopefully soon I will be able to get Jekyll to work and render all these markdown files into webpages.
  
This also comes at a time when I am having some serious problems with my productivity and can't stop thinking of things I could be doing, but can't get myself to actually do them. I've largely been on a break for almost a month. Hopefully writing down some thoughts publicly will help me be more focused.
