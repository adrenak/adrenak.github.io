Booked xr.buzz, a pretty premier sounding domain name. The idea is to make a news portal around AR and VR industry. Tried to work with WordPress themes, but I guess I will leave a specialist to set that up for me.  
  
There are a lot of websites like RoadToVR, VRFocus and VRScout that publish news about the industry. But I have some other intentions as well, mostly because I see this as a different opportunity as I am a develop myself. I also have worked a bit in adtech so I have some good revenue intentions as well.

Also, from tomorrow I am working on resuming [Karnage](https://www.facebook.com/KarnageFPS/).

I briefly worked on Karnage in 2016. At that time I was in Mumbai and quite occupied with working on [Plakc](http://www.plakc.com). The idea was to make a 90s style shooter game with the speed and intensity of Quake, or something like that. I made a bunch of levels, released a few early videos and was approaching the code in a pretty organised way.  
  
Recently I played [Krunker](Krunker.io), which is basically an Counter Strike like IO game. The game seems to be doing well. There has also been a surge in the number of games being made with a 90s style. This seems to have especially been picked up in the horror genre.

So I decided, I will make Karnage again, although with a different name as there is already a [Karnage IO game](http://www.Karnage.io). Did quite a lot of research and looks like I will give [PlayerIO](https://www.playerio.com) a try for making all the networked features of the game. PlayerIO is honestly looking like the most promising network SDK I have ever seen. It takes care of analytics, purchases, DB, multiplayer, invitations, notifications. It is pretty insane and looks incredibly easy to use. The API looks brilliant and I will likely pick up some ideas for [AirPeer](https//www.github.com/adrenak/AirPeer).

The idea is to make this for VR, Mobile, and PC & Web. But no game really takes off without a good marketing strategy. I have one that I will share soon.
