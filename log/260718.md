I have been anything but productive for the last few weeks. Since yesterday I am back to work now.  

For a project I am working on, I have to make a VR video application. I've made a lot of those, and it is honestly just the same thing with different variations. 
This time, however, there was a unique requirement. I have to output the video being played in a different window, like a separate external application.

I have never come across anything like this and I almost gave up. Until I saw [this](https://github.com/mrayy/UnityCam/)

The code allows any `Texture` to be output as if it was a webcam on the operating system. So, you can output the camera's render to skype, for example.

I forked the repository and refactored it. I think the code really needed some of that. It is not available [here](https://www.github.com/adrenak/UnityCam)
